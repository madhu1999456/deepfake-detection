## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madhu1999456/deepfake-detection.git
   cd deepfake-detection


Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



🚀 Usage

Place your dataset in the data/ folder.

Run preprocessing and training scripts:

python src/train_model.py


View results or run Jupyter notebooks:

jupyter notebook



🧠 Model Overview

The detection model is built using TensorFlow or PyTorch and trained on face datasets such as FaceForensics++ or custom deepfake datasets.
The pipeline includes:

Face detection and extraction

Feature learning using CNNs

Classification of real vs. fake media




🧩 Future Improvements

Add video-level deepfake detection

Improve accuracy using attention-based architectures

Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
